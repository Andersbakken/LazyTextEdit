LazyTextEdit is a Qt based text editor that lazily loads data from disk when
necessary.

It tries to keep memory usage as low as possible and only stores chunks of data
that have been modified. Its APIs resembles that of
QText(Edit|Document|Cursor). It supports basic formatting options using
TextSections and SyntaxHighlighter.
